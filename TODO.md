## Stack Allocation and Strings
One problem that I find interesting is trying to do efficient string manipulation. What I might do is make it so that string.h:create_string copies a string from a given pointer into a stack based allocator, or something similar. Not necessarily a buffer, but more like a stack allocation mechanism that persists as long as main persists. That'll ensure that the allocation is never deallocated automatically unless main returns. I am thinking that string_store.h could do stack based allocations by creating at least 4KB on the stack primarily for string manipulation. This would make string copy, string concatenation, and other forms of string manipulation (formatting, trimming, etc) much more efficient, and easier to work with, instead of passing around pointers to a string constant in the data section of the executable.
